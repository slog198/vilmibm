    The prejudices of mankind on a subject so nearly concerned with their dearest interests and affections must inevitably be powerful and obstinate
    the haymakers were at work all along the road
    the Saturn will become a powder or lump
    I was following the windings of an unknown road
    
    Those Cardassian pigs didn't kill your brother
    the last sacrament is being administered
    Again, to think is to relate things to one another definitely
    they bequeath an awful legacy of sickness to their children--an amount of suffering which is almost disproportionate to their own
    
    ‘Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here
    Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia
    and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known
    part from her authoritative manner
    
    and enquire of Baalzebub
    Apollonius met the procession
