    No one took the trouble to grunt even
    To the traditional cat in a strange garret
    for initiative, or for order even
    and a helper amongst Indian women
    
    But two miles more, and then we rest
    She hastily put down the bottle
    that he was prevailed on to think as they thought
    Beneath my searching eye All mist and darkness melt away
    
    vases of exotics bloomed on all sides
    straightforward, and definite regulation
    350 304 50 4 2 477 7 61 0 11 British
    Shop Hours Regulation Act
    
    Here comes Madam Mina
    A most delightful place
