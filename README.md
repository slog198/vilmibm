    Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby
    She gnaws their fingers
    This is to my mind the nicest spot in Whitby
    I can tell you whether I found any one I liked
    
    and he pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty
    hurried into the vestibule
    and was driven by the magician to her sty
    Moreover, the tip was enough higher than the base
    
    but the uncertain light from the hearth showed
    Their father then went on to the library to write
    then dropped on one knee at his feet
    yet, coming from a supernatural enemy
    
    it was neither more nor less than a pig
    I should get a respectable locksmith
