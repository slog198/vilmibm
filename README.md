    Then why not Alaska likewise some day
    And before my dreaming eyes Still the learned volumes lay
    and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly
    but if efficiently carried out it should do something to shorten the working hours of those for whom it is specially designed--children and young persons
    
    till your Matter come over as red as Bloud
    He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship
    It is good for us to resort to the house of those that mourn
    but it is not directed and trained
    
    Legislation cannot be long deferred
    And they, perchance, heard vows of mine
    but likewise you will find it thus
    We desire neither the slow mind nor yet the hasty
    
    g of the gold, as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging
    resembling an immense snake uncoiled
