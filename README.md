    burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman
    Darest thou turn aside
    In two or three minutes later Van Helsing was in the room in his dressing-gown
    as she was sitting with her two elder sisters
    
    why is it beautiful why is it not when there is no doubt
    even at sea level, more than thirty-three feet
    She handles my finances and shes a female
    For practical purposes 100 Roman feet 97 English feet
    
    Hidden away amongst scenes like these Under the fans of the chestnut trees
    The purchaser is a foreign nobleman
    he breathed fast and low
    Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts
    
    then he shall know all
    for I feared the next sentence might be rough
