    And there was a pleasure in my services
    and seemingly without a window of any sort
    We have to do something
    that you observe all that which I have revealed unto you
    
    Seward tried one or two skeleton keys
    is requested to send references
    Yet a chance traveller might pass by
    Other Volumes are in preparation
    
    or the scheme of the ordinary roads
    and set the other half again to multiply
    If these are survivals of other such roads
    at last, in obedience to his will she made reply
    
    and soon every mortal foot danced by the white foot of an immortal
    but my spirits might often lead me wrong
