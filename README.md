    and, when we shall cease to be inconsistent
    Jonathan Harkers Journal
    And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie
    taken the third degree at some time during his long life
    
    but before our very eyes
    Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent
    I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper
    These he called the idols
    
    No place of petty shows and fond displays
    and when the indefinite world
    I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze
    from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph
    
    The dog is always with him
    Most of these cities sprang up full-grown
