    He was tired as they ascended slowly toward the surface
    It was the colony's central factory
    Let me ask you, that stuff Easy Money took off you
    The soft shadows tended to clothe them with mystery
    
    the walls whitewashed to make it seem larger
    Hed told Rydell how the computer had mapped his back and showed him exactly what it was going to look like when it was done
    and now the man's eyes seemed to grow larger
    Nothing, neither virus nor intelligence
    
    And he thought, the logic of Underground
    I can move the control mesh to wherever I like
    but the pain came from somewhere deep underground
    Death is desirable as our passage to paradise
    
    too deaf or past-it to know about the curfew
    My eyes live again, seeing you O my nephew
