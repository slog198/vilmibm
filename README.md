    to wash them, then take a Silver Syringe
    For other token do not seek
    gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge
    for cooperation touches them on many sides
    
    The manager thinks you ought to be hanged
    and with them subdued the people of Spaine fronting upon his marches
    calmed down, convinced and finally won over
    and were then allowed to crawl away and rest
    
    and deeply to imbue them with sentiments of religion
    with no harsh wind, no forgetting duty
    was simply the logical result of his care
    The letters were upside down to me from where I sat
    
    so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue
    I addressed some phrases to her in her own tongue
