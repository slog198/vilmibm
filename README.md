    and threw him into the water for a witch
    and gave it to Elizabeth
    
    and somewhere far off an early cock crew

    and even then several weeks practice is required before he learns the adjustment so as neither to overreach nor to underreach
    Is there not love in my heart

    grant me at least a new servitude
