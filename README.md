    Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough
    I have bloomed in my last summer's sun
    ’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long enough
    My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us
    
    had powdered hair that curled all over their heads
    and insisted on my being put under control
    light pink Petunias the other two beds
    her household and tenantry were thoroughly under her control
    
    no chimneys--all had crashed in
    The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan
    but I was overruled, as I always am
    except that I knew I was coming to Jonathan
    
    I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel
    Mason than you have from me
