    that uncanny turn of countenance mean
    and a homage to his omnipotence
    The kiss of the sun for pardon
    called the Park; and there were many children there besides me
    
    too, know not what it mean--what it might mean
    I am ignorant of all concerning Mr
    I had full information about all these things
    till all be dissolved
    
    self-importance and humility
    a tragic and familiar Shade
    I may enter his county with impunity
    With what has been called the religion of the Magi
    
    for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ----shire
    Contrast between Yorkshire and Lancashire
