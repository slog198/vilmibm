    I had hung my shaving glass by the window
    But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew
    I came back again; I walked to the window
    that only tend to elate and magnify a few
    
    A sharpa wire stiletto
    better than will the most ingenious pedagogical devices unaccompanied by this mental ardor
    Some parleying was audible in the hall
    It's Pel, that flabby eared interloper
    
    If you think you have the heart to venture
    and she was covered with a white sheet
    After the Easter recess
    She nodded in reply to show that she understood
    
    His position had come to him--why
    If sometimes in thy heart should beat One pulse
