    Such failures as these are not really a test of genuine cooperation
    Grant this--and be hereafter paid By a warm heart's devoted aid
    and their reply; of both of these I got copies
    we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying
    
    It would be past the power of magic
    Indeed, it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed

    If you do not understand the English language

    and exclaimed, Oh, what a little puppet
