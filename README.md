    Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound
    this high red pouder will then begin to flux
    when somebody said in my ear
    and my frankness was congealed beneath it
    
    you will take cold to a dead certainty
    But, apart from the provisions mentioned above
    At Ridgeland Farm, in Westchester County
    Quite apart from the considerations urged above
    
    We went at once into our Plan of Campaign
    and yet requires constantly to be redrawn
    and have had much sorrow and much mental pain
    To get convictions every vice employs
    
    Mother cried out in a fright
    I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically
