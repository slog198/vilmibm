    If he does go, the change will be doleful
    Repentance, and true Humility
    blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful
    ' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety
    
    One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the windowpanes
    which everybody here is of course familiar with
    the beating of winter rain against the panes
    an occupation of which she was fond
    
    now on the new facts that frame the problem
    but merely as suggesting it
    And at last, in its curved and imperceptible fall
    no doubt, drawn from the later chapters of Ezekiel
    
    shines never clear, And oft in clouds is wholly lost
    every day, like a new holocaust
