    jlevy@azstarnet.com (Jerry Levy)Date: Fri, 19 Jan 1996 06:01:42 GMTWith this game you just have to stay at it, and at it, and at it.Remember you are living a nightmare so frustration is part of thepain.The game does seem to like a certain order of play as I found fromstarting over once or twice, infact I recommend starting over once youare thorughly confused and realize this is no longer a "game" it willallow you to concentrate more on the stories.I would recommend this in terms of order of play, not spoilers(remember to listen for the whispering voices...):1) in the upstairs study, do the wine bottle for the carnival, souljump first chance you get;2) second time you hear the whispering in the house go back to thewine bottle and play through again w/o soul jumping.3) Tell tale heart: First time through soul jump, 2nd time do not,go in through the cleaver both times.4) Do the poem in the second floor Bedroom to the left, the Red Deathin the basement, 5) Play Berniece(?)
