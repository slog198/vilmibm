    he cut a thick slice from his loaf
    A certain superciliousness of look
    which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall
    It was enough to attract his mother's attention
    
    not for them, should we despair
    I'll keep your holosuites running and fix your replicators when they're broken
    Donelson by name, who told us of his voyage
    â€˜because of his great wig
    
    to order and civilisation
    one with the keeper about the new suit of clothes
    my dear, said he, and your food somewhat on your appetite
    She is young as Un-Dead
    
    the vacant chair; And hear it whispered mournfully
    It is too soon for her to give up business
