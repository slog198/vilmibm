    large woman, with strongly-marked features
    Although under oath to tell all
    more complex in range
    And though its halls are fair within-- Oh
    
    that they may not putrefie or stink
    he made them the more tractable and obedient to his will
    1 The premises are called grounds
    A being whose very presence blest Like gladsome summer-day
    
    to be made useful, to be kept humble
    and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were
    who was worshipped in the likeness of a ram
    ‘Everything’s got a moral
    
    when we are tempted to repudiate their follies
    Dee continually soothed him
