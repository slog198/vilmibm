    It does not do to trust people too much
    r the sanitary conditions of workshops
    but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much
    The generation of Tin in and above the Earth
    
    and events perpetually occurred
    One good screech will do more for you than all your rifles
    and taking up another ring and more tape
    He really did want to open the door
    
    lying in the plain close to the harbour
    Tis sweet to think that thou hast been
    which broadens out as it comes near the harbour
    we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee
    
    Never did I imagine such wrath and fury
    Keeping my cab at the gate
