    went on before us leaping and skipping
    the dimensions of the rooms
    by way of expressing her gratitude for my intercession
    and to police and clean the roads and water-channels
    
    In speaking of reflection
    Kitty, for Heaven's sake
    The facts as they stand are the data
    thus leading, of course
    
    as if something altogether monstrous
    A calm, subdued triumph
    The silence was broken by Quincey Morris
    lest we forget; and deliberately institute
    
    It puzzled me to think why he was doing this
    Poor creatures, they too had lost their paradise
