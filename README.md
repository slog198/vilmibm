    Nice game, but why is everything so dark
    They offerthe really challenging missions, and they pay quite well.
    When you attempt to take something that isn't yours
    If you ever take out the governor, come back and collectmore credits.From here on, you either head to Tayla or go see Sandra Goodin(Confed)
    
    You'll be using this a hell of a lot
    and given that street name as his geographical tag
    Note
    *-*BACKGROUND
    
    good interface, but it is kind of short in the long run without a lot of replayability
    A guard is around that crate
    L E V E L T H R E E - S I M P L E W A L K T H R O U G H =============================================================================Well, the difficulty of the game *has* just been stepped up a notch.
    - but instead of getting Britannia, you get a weird mixture of  dungeon floors, walls, creatures (some that just sit there like statues,  etc.)
    
    If you take shots at a enemy that hasn't been targeted yet
    the ball eats you.
