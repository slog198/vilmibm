    put this Matter so ground into a Pot
    He next turned in pursuit of the adulterer
    or Iâ€™ll have you executed on the spot
    called on me one day and made inquiries
    
    It was too far to return to dinner

    It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face

    They were presently put to the torture
    which makes a breach and difference

    ol the multitude of partisans who insisted on their immediate release
    
    From the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance
    --she corrected herself with beautiful generosity
