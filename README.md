    A colored loss, why is there no leisure
    Now, I'm coming with you and that's final
    Waked by the lightsome touch of pleasure
    Grace Poole--you have guessed it
    
    No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it
    sometimes she would come up in the interval to seek her thimble or her scissors
    as the great Psalmist says
    He steered with no end of a swagger while you were by
    
    still, such as she was
    by moonlight, and tracked her into a place of graves
    and wilfully refused the benefite thereof
    to creep, to walk, and so on
    
    the lips were swelled and dark
    The problem is to reduce the apparent anomalies to instances of well-established laws
