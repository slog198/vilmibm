    No notice was taken; and a long pause ensued
    so that gradually it shall become a conscious tool of conveying knowledge and assisting thought
    a whole waggon-load of morrice-dancers and jugglers
    
    with very dark houses and all smoky
    But in photography detail is lost when the camera is at sufficient distance to include more than a small section of such a design
    which is part of a larger plan
    as if against the central-asiatic nomads

    which made him feel quite sad
    then another fellow, one of the dead ones
    The attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over
    
    whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own
    cried out-- N'est-ce pas
