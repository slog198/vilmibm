    when one reads a great deal and works out chess problems with bits of paper on a home-made board
    Princeton, Columbia in America
    on all occasions fortitude pleased him
    Thank God it is no worse
    
    I am blest; It turns my darkest night to day
    The Benchers might admit them as certificated conveyancers
    His father is said to have lived in some repute
    and had to call two or three times before she awoke
    
    ‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh
    I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf
    He considered it necessary to sigh
    Jack ashore--with a difference--in externals only
    
    He lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip
    Teatina on the north
