    Having brought my eventide musings to this point
    Again I could not but notice his prodigious strength
    muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders
    and on the contrary observe the bare words at length
    
    they form a more than interesting study
    sir; and, in Heaven's name
    of course, in every subject of study
    This ship could outrun a Romulan interceptor
    
    left to myself I abandoned myself
    resulting in the slighter cases in faintness
    I heard the visitors repair to their chambers
    thus leading, of course
    
    The cloven halves were not broken from each other
    under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind
