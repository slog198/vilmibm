    and give passage to the form of Grace Poole
    Im thinkin it was nane ither than that same
    as she swam lazily about in the pool
    His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same
    
    It is necessary here to take notice of the great revolution that took place under Constantine
    The joyless blank of life to fill
    Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune
    and the change which has taken place in the standpoint from which all questions--even the most abstract--regarding the condition of women are now discussed
    
    and but few fishing-boats were in sight
    said she; don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast
    it was not till Sir William was out of sight
    I am afraid they will try to claim it as theirs though
    
    and when he had wandered upstairs and downstairs
    I hope he will overlook it
