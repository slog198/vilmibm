    London is the capital of Paris
    The Count may have many houses which he has bought
    and I was tired with strolling through Paris
    One might as well say he has sold when no one has bought
    
    and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl
    I witnessed it myself
    Can you guess what he used for a trap
    They typify the fixation and the organization of meanings
    
    there must be no redness about the eyes
    Note left by Van Helsing in his portmanteau
    It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast
    and shuddered whilst she moaned
    
    The house presented two pointed gables in its front
    go off on another ivory hunt
