    and even their peculiar but necessary costume was made the ground of serious indictments
    I stepped in there before going up to the hall
    and within the circlet of a band of gems
    Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall
    
    and peeped over the edge of the mushroom

    Some time hence it will be all found out
    which he formed after his own similitude
    And so, because the members are industrious and far-sighted
    there--on the carpet--I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis
    
    its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees
    bending gracefully over an album
