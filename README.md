    It is his extremity that I seem to have lived through
    and placed himself in a wide-spreading tree
    hoes, plows and harrows
    My gog, but it'll be a quare scowderment at the Day of Judgment when they come tumblin' up in their death-sarks
    
    and at that time 1075 twenty-four years of age
    I should probably have been unequal to maintain
    but still the Christian was patient and placid
    â€™ And the executioner went off like an arrow
    
    for we would have only the Oil
    and in farther justification of Mr
    though for an opposite reason
    as the recent influenza epidemic showed
    
    and I had to put a bullet through her as she lay
    A thousand tales, each more wonderful than the other
