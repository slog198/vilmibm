    All right, then, where was Marly
    a clam, a scallop, and a few tropical fish
    Hello, Daizaburo, dear old colleague
    with my hands pressed against my chest
    
    the way they do, shy and cautious
    stuffed a makeshift pad into her underwear
    Bunny buzzed her on her way out and gave her 50 Beale
    I am being well cared for
    
    so touchingly proud of her wonderful gown
    Kmuzu tended me conÂ­stantly
    said the shaykh's brother
    she was out in a matter of moments
    
    She became pure glass
    O Shaykh, I said, but I am unworthy
