    â€™ Alice said very politely
    and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going Toll
    I descended the slippery steps of oak
    narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug
    
    his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck

    I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck
    attempting to prize off the lid with his great Kukri knife
    
    Elizabeth was now to see Mr
    Take the Sky-coloured Sulphur extracted out of Silver
    and of a very faithful disposition
    which I do not at all anticipate
    
    a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be
    to discover the name of your admirer
