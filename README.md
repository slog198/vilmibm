    In it are no prisoners and no crime
    not at all like the pretty clean town I came from
    It seemed to me that
    eight insulae' were taken up by the Forum
    
    and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill
    â€™ said the Queen furiously
    commonly called the Maid of Orleans
    We could hear the click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down
    
    Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide
    and comes at a peculiarly mournful season
    He bowed in a courtly way as he replied
    enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season
    
    Dance a clean dream and an extravagant turn up
    whilst he shook with emotion
