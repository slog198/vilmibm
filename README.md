    but each was given in simple good faith
    Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror
    all which is only to be obtained by Faith
    who, astonished and confused
    
    as sure as ferrets are ferrets
    and they had recourse to the stake and the faggot
    We sat down and waited for the jury
    Engagement is almost always for the run of a single piece only
    
    Here then is a Corsair-song
    so it did not enlarge
    as we read of in the annals of witchcraft
    Matchbox-makers of Shoreditch and Bow
    
    I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio
    left to myself I abandoned myself
