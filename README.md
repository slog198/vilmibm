    Yes, maam--but she looks such a tinkler
    wherefore it is not amiss to observe
    although the climates are very similar
    As Machiavelli thought it worth while to observe
    
    Jane recollected herself soon
    The streets which preserve Roman lines are marked in black
    the first part still existing in manuscript
    is very imposing: they are all costumed in black
    
    I have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened
    the friar did not dare to trust the punishment of his enemies to the general assembly
    and then waited day after day
    The gypsies may not have known the language
    
    addressing me, she said-- You ought to be aware
    but with the sternest look that his face could wear
