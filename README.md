    helped perhaps by his mysterious glamour
    and laid quietly side by side under one slab
    during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer
    about fifteen or sixteen
    
    i a felt difficulty; ii its location and definition
    that he should shortly have a maruellous good thing happen to him
    lights are not ponderous and incalculable
    And for a moment it seemed to me as if I also were buried in a vast grave full of unspeakable secrets
    
    and somewhere far off an early cock crew
    and alarm the inhabitants of the globe with the sight of devouring flames
    * * * * * On 14 July was somewhat anxious about crew
    What sweet madness has seized me
    
    though I could see no stars and only by a vague
    V I awoke suddenly as though something had awakened me
