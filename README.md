    Try and run away from something in L
    that Lumiere moment, the steam locomotive about to emerge from the screen
    Like most port-equipped buildings in L
    Griffith fumbled for his inhaler
    
    but found it difficult
    She accidentally dropped the virtual chalk
    Down there the spread of lights through the faint glaze of some previous passenger's hair-oil
    knowing she couldnâ€™t let go of the controls to slap him away
    
    We had to see whether you still had what it takes
    It's death to set foot in the Sterilized Zone
    The question echoed like madness in Gabe's head
    You shouldn't take your baby into a bio-hazard zone
    
    Copperthwait took his hand and gave it a hard squeeze
    Percy gave her and Rosa a hard squeeze
