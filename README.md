    and at the mercy of Lord Godalming and Dr
    we would be absolutely in the air--in space
    Nothing can be more striking than the contrast between man and the inferior animals
    so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace
    
    if I were in your place
    The third case, that of the appearance and movement of the bubbles
    And that blest home above
    you and I, and all the rest of us
    
    The headships of colleges and training colleges available are of course very limited in number
    would have succumbed now
    Their problems are quite unlike those of the ancients
    I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night
    
    Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous
    if our comfort springs from a breach of promise
