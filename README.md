    many--perhaps most--of the towns to which it was applied were coloniae' manned by time-expired soldiers
    Ah, I doubt not that in old time
    and we come together to see our pretty miss
    I again move the introduction of a new topic
    
    for never did green bay tree so flourish
    I should have considered it as part of my duty
    was fronted by at least thirteen insulae'
    as if a man had anything to do with beauty
    
    because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences
    Sons, & Candy, the house agents
    We do not approach any problem with a wholly na√Øve or virgin mind
    for, though dilatory in undertaking business
    
    and the sun as I write is hidden in thick clouds
    hides the face of heaven with murky clouds
