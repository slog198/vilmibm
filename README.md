    not choosing to notice this last remark
    of which he constituted himself president
    Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark
    And while she broke the seal and perused the document
    
    laid down on my traveller's bed
    and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues
    Yes, Robert, I shall be ready
    could be guilty of such a crime
    
    but a second look dispelled the illusion
    they must needs come wriggling down from the sky
    and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house
    he cried out to me:-- It is not yet too late
    
    Your words are such as ought not to be used
    Till, drop by drop, the cup of joy Filled full
