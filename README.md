    PLATE 139 Fairlawn, Grosse Pointe Shores
    and when I tried to cling to Him
    If it be that she can
    and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters
    
    They could talk of nothing but officers
    and being secreted by his mother in a cave
    and heard your impetuous republican answers
    I mean, other people in your situation might overreact and lose their temper
    
    and was sleeping peacefully
    ROOMS Act so that there is no use in a centre
    Where Pleasure still will lead to wrong
    and the days in my color factory in the winter
    
    that good Rule be observed
    It seemed to me I had never breathed an atmosphere so vile
