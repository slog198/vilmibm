    This gave me a fright
    She make no entry into her little diary
    497; Cagnat, Année Épigr
    He is now reading his wife's typescript of my diary
    
    Who for such dainties would not stoop
    If that repose seem woe
    I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself
    It will be a change for me to visit you now and then
    
    He next turned in pursuit of the adulterer
    I never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before
    --Do not fail to be at Hillingham to-night
    Just opening into sight
    
    Yet, pitying God, abridge the time Of anguish
    Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish
