    I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper
    the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale
    But I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper
    considering everything why is there no restraint
    
    both of you, than friend John here
    these were ornamented all over with diamonds
    I instantly resolved on setting off for this place
    As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds
    
    Seward ; this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning
    The superintendent of elections was the night keeper
    and makes their eyes white
    together with the mode and the amount of its operation
    
    and it all seems like a horrible tragedy
    The muscular hand broke from my custody
