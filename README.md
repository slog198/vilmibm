    I will go out of doors and feel it
    in addition they are frequently treacherous
    That must be why you're losing so badly
    have not influence to cure me of my faults
    
    Indeed I do, was the reply
    without concealed speeches
    --It is impossible to give any estimate of the value of either music or painting as a means of livelihood
    and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse
    
    it must be admitted that there has been
    even such as I had noticed in the howling sorrow of these savages in the bush
    I was not so sleepy as I should have been
    and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire
    
    Thank God there is the other copy in the safe
    so now he is intent on being safe
