    of these detestable slaves of the Diuel
    and are blind to the full brightness of the orb
    â€˜You insult me by talking such nonsense
    Never the glorious view to greet Of hill and dale
    
    Rule of Acquisition two twenty nine
    and in a way that made me shudder
    that they may repent and be converted
    to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day
    
    however, only another instance of his cunning
    I have given the last memento of my sister Emily
    One of these facts, the weight of the atmosphere
    which is, perhaps, less frequented than the other parts
    
    we are scarcely less eager to meet her again
    on which reflection would be long indulged
