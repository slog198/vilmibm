    It had had a sleep and taken some food
    A plan of spring and autumn tours has been arranged
    Occasionally, for want of other food
    He really ought to have expected things to have changed
    
    He has written a great number of works
    Collins was eloquent in her praise
    My footsteps never slide
    she ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me
    
    Each time I have gone prepared for the end
    it will soon after fall into dust
    Probably they have not done so because they have not quite seen how to set about it
    and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls
    
    who thought fit to bridle at the direct address
    and took the warmest interest in its progress
