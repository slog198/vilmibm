    Taken merely as a certainty
    but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the Count's house
    The man touched his hat
    
    merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife
    as friend Arthur would say when he put on his red frock
    that it would be a trying thing to be his wife
    She is able to compel the solid earth to rock

    that all the jurors were writing down â€˜stupid things
    Again she regarded me so icily
    I am excessively attentive to all those things
    
    in token that he was tired of our company
    preparing to oblige the company
