    guard me as well alone as with any one present
    18, so that I shall have no fear to-night
    He considered it necessary to sigh
    He was active in his observations on the subject
    
    crawling up and down his cell on his hands and knees
    into which the sand-points stretch like grey fingers
    so to make sure, I said interrogatively
    the miserable wretch slided from between his fingers
    
    and no pleasure excite them agreeably
    Now for five years they have had the same manager
    We will go round the Park every day
    He had great reputation as an astrologer
    
    Imagine him here--the very end of the world
    therefore there, is none so poor in this world
