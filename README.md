    They were like living anatomy charts
    Not because our genetics are bad
    Bypass those unreliable body parts
    Like Weinraub on Gargotier’s patio
    
    Only my uncle stumbled into the trap
    the sort who rode shotgun through Comanche country and had six kids without anesthetic
    What we got, is two air masses m a scrap
    Yeah, I'd go through a roll of fax paper every couple of days
    
    And then Cobb remembered their cover story
    These data- haven people are professionals
    Diana, you are the key to this story
    Time to get going or Cynthia would
    
    The fragment’s still hot enough to melt rock at its core
    We're not the ones to talk on that score
