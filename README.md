    George Woodward From a photograph by J
    We seem to be drifting to some terrible doom
    with the same Vincenzio Romoli
    and a little bit of Exodus
    
    Who for such dainties would not stoop
    And hide me from the hostile light That does not warm
    would bring on those to whom
    It was please it was please carriage cup in an ice-cream
    
    when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery
    and its restoration just a century later
    The garden was a wide inclosure
    or John Paxton, drowned off Cape Farewell a year later
    
    He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud
    I look out of the window at the crowd
