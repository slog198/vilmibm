    and that brow professes to say
    That depends on circumstances
    had come to my cage with the burning paper spill
    and vied with each other in reciting the miraculous phenomena which marked every step in her progress
    
    They were presently put to the torture
    to mere school traditions
    I see the necessity of departure
    Tom, with a cheery laugh
    
    Actually, I don't like jumja sticks
    and Elizabeth, agitated and confused
    By what applications shall I try to fix
    Lizzy, cried her mother
    
    I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes
    What makes you so venturesome and hardy
