    Oh it's right behind the spatula
    an Irish saint, is exceedingly picturesque
    then they shall know as we do
    for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment
    
    Once or twice she could discern a faint blush
    when we knew, from the evidence of our own eyesight
    and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed
    the whole body crumble into dust and passed from our sight
    
    Austria, Germany, Bohemia
    sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly
    He visited the mines of Bohemia
    And I saw that something restraining
    
    I long to hope that all the woe Creation knows
    And, above all, no blowing of the nose
