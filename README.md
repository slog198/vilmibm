    fly; Swept from Eternity's repose
    and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside--or rather
    and they supposed, or pretended to suppose
    Morris arrived earlier than we expected
    
    I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton
    It gazed and gazed on me
    as the great World to the lesser
    Collins was first introduced to her notice
    
    glittered and trembled at every step
    but if it may be that she can see them again
    He seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will
    For at this hour you do not want me for nothings
    
    the white teeth champing with rage
    Lord, help me, and those to whom I am dear
