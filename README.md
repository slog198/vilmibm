    L,F , you find a particularly interesting box
    and the game does kind of suck you in over time
    You have heard the whispers of something greater than you in your sleep
    I knew my mum was wrong when she said greens were good forme.
    
    When you struggle to survive
    Exit the room L,F Head back down the hall L
      Agent  When you act in service of The Crown
    Go over to the other door and walk though it L
    
    all allies who can see you are +D8 extent
    Jump through, andJones will be there
    perform an MRI scan to view the elevator pumps
    I see the Freak Wave has been up to his old tricks.
    
    Too early
    is flying a Talon.
