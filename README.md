    Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse
    Now let us to-day put all our affairs in order
    Can you guess what he used for a trap
    When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen
    
    whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long
    Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no choice as he saw
    We can know now what was in the Count's mind
    There must be no chances
    
    that the world, and men for whom His Son die
    So we shall, if we have not yet catch him and destroy him
    I had some fear--or hope--that here I should die
    That Providence may ne'er intend The trembling heart to bear
    
    A complete act of thought involves both--it involves
    The spectators buzzed it among themselves
