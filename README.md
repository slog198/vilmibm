    to carry my point in going to Brighton
    repeated three or four times how much they were grieved
    CHAPTER XX I had forgotten to draw my curtain
    and the more the seniors inculcated and believed
    
    His is the exaction of the apostle
    a Gift which God bestows upon his Friends
    and introduced to secretary Cecil
    There were strong men there
    
    they deal with it, and know not what they have
    Gone, disappeared; swept off without leaving a whisper or a shadow behind
    If we had not used it that blessed child would have
    By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice
    
    but whatever mood the apparition evinced
    but by forethought could be guarded against
