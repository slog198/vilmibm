    Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings
    In a sense at least, it was laid out with its streets straight
    You make me laugh, Charlotte
    The reverence borne to these principles is so great
    
    placed a yard or two back within the room
    and before she could strike into another path
    Westenra coming out of the morning room
    The game is over, and I have lost
    
    she would give us a large piece of cold pie
    till, borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the Pass
    The horrid shade, by slow degrees
    Scarcely dared I answer her
    
    she cheated me; And she will prove as false to thee
    and an allowance of cold meat and bread
