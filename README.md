    98 a more judicious author than Pliny
    Samsa were struck, almost simultaneously
    Sugar any sugar, anger every anger
    and the net of doom was closing round me more closely
    
    There is one point on which I want your advice
    they were even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go
    You won't let me install the cloaking device
    and said, You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment
    
    But it was far otherwise with the Greeks
    The undertaker had certainly done his work well
    The man, who seemed a decent fellow enough
    But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your Well
    
    discovering secrets, restoring stolen goods
    had made the best display he could of his goods
