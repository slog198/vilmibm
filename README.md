    When youâ€™re struggling to survive
    X,R,X , and duck for cover R after Yikes
    All four pumps fall at different rates
    
    
    10,000MK II: Target Lock.
    This doesn't seem to accomplish much of anything that I can tell
    Once per scene, when you invoke the authority of The Crown
    They can be dropped in your Village Store for extra food.Always a good idea to stock up while you have the chance.
    
    in addition to your core three six-sided dice
    Nasty virus, and it's spreading through the complex
    ..
    You don'tnessessarily have to cast it into the Village Store, just make sure thereare lots of people near where you cast it.
    
    Walk over to the door R
