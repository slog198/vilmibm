    A little monkey goes like a donkey
    the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane
    weeks, and months pass by
    he became instantly the prey of an abject funk
    
    the high temperature maintained in the mills
    and the duchess of Gloucester as accessory
    a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills
    Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery
    
    Let the fool gape and shudder--the man knows
    Morris was looking steadily at the window
    and the other doctor who attended her knows
    I shall not mind any flapping outside the window
    
    ye could tell what they said
    who, with minds perfectly disengaged and free
