    but I carry the rosary about my neck
    of which we can form no idea
    The expression sounded wonderfully odd
    Give the party three drops in the beginning of the Fit
    
    Ladies, said he, turning to his family
    Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule
    Bennet could hardly comprehend it
    where golden California Poppies make way for you to pass
    
    take me out of this and save my soul from guilt
    he's so stubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well
    my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt
    yes--it would be much better to wait till Jane was well
    
    I was loaded with general opprobrium
    the great crowd in the auditorium
