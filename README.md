    the Sulphur is then fixd which is therein
    all the evil things in the world will have full sway
    that if any thing should yet remain therein
    though there is a period of time which I remember mistily
    
    to-morrow I will write the other half
    her disk was blood-red and half overcast
    and we put a white one in by mistake
    My tears collect, and fall unfelt
    
    The space of a minute having elapsed
    and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce
    until the seventh or eighth month has elapsed
    Maybe not poison, but a small intestinal bug
    
    or shades of night, Have wrapt the parent orb away
    musical laugh, but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips
