    I saw I had strayed far from the village
    ' Certainly he fidgeted on his chair a good deal
    What an excellent father you have
    By following up this clue we may learn a good deal
    
    did the china cups and bright teapot look
    I daresay I was not very well at that time
    he looks an old manâ€”I wonder how I look
    Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time
    
    it will help me to bear up
    and a valiant man besides in present danger
    and leave the next generation to purchase
    we are to be informed by a special messenger
    
    but not the artistic spirit par excellence
    I must not decide on my own performance
