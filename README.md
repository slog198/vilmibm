    There on the bed, seemingly in a swoon
    So, resting on a heathy bank
    I know you will do him such ample justice
    These things serve to shew of what importance he was in his own eyes
    
    the place is not in effect a real town
    Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier
    During Gregor's short periods in town
    and the place as bare as a stubble-field
    
    inasmuch as it supposed the creator of the world to be subject to the influence of the stars
    Each of the others was similarly equipped
    We went at once into our Plan of Campaign
    Do you know why I asked her to get the manuscript
    
    who come in and help at times of special pressure
    So I said as gently as I could
