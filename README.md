    pictured it as a city lying foursquare
    I perfectly comprehend your feelings
    cavation has as yet yielded no proofs
    my horses will have enough to do to drag their proper load
    
    Mary and I have had, I should think
    and which tend to create mechanical routine
    and ages seemed to pass
    take out with me to India a girl of nineteen
    
    but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea
    Rodolph, the competitor for the empire
    â€™ she said to herself in a melancholy tone
    Forced to behold that visage
    
    the problem was theoretical
    but many think he had better be dead
