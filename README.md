    in the perfect lifting of an arm
    I have no doubt that he believes it all
    Shorty’s time drew near
    and was working in his drawers
    
    The rest of us are, with what patience we can
    ‘Off with their heads
    cavation has as yet yielded no proofs
    the way he used to in old days before I went to school
    
    69 70 MANOR HOUSE, GLEN COVE
    that selfishness is prudence
    And, with a warning look and his finger on his lip
    The envelope itself was likewise full
    
    I obeyed him, and walked down to the traveller
    room to search a light that is simpler
