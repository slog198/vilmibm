    for it tells in its way the story of his race
    County of New York, for after all this fuss and expenditure
    I can tell you this--if the whole human race
    For those who live out of sight of this great industry
    
    Perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain
    But suppose the agonized mother to have been dead many years
    the thought of subway or elevated train
    growling over it as a dog growls over a bone

    but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise
    covered with a film of dust
    We are due to arrive between two and three in the morning
    
    who call every few moments for interviews
    Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views
