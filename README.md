    The gypsies may not have known the language
    The high stillness confronted these two figures with its ominous patience
    they vented their wrath in curses and ill language
    in which the noble poet saw this beautiful dame
    
    He, don't you see, had been planning to be assistant-manager by and by under the present man
    I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these
    I thought, I continued
    And I think you will agree with me
    
    and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window
    I could see Renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house
    great-uncle to the king
    Fortunately I am not of a fainting disposition
    
    and I went back to the room where Lucy now was
    you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee
