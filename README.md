    It sounds good to me
    and millions are in silent revolt against their lot
    it is because I am insane--quite insane
    Girt in with fertile solitude
    
    has been therefore given to the fair sex
    Again he went into the grounds of the deserted house
    stood near these three streets fig
    and consequently such early bloomers as Tulips
    
    He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm
    I have never experienced the third degree
    yet clear; and therein was my only chance--barring
    Does it not furnish further proof of the fourth degree

    How very thin, and how very bloodless
