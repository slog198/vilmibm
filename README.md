    Did you hear the way Gregor spoke just now
    On recovery she worked for two years in the stoves
    there are only some bits of walls standing now
    and solemnising of other culinary rites
    
    but for some error of pronunciation
    she soon afterwards said
    as is plainly taught in the Book of Sulphurs
    my horses will have enough to do to drag their proper load
    
    and will save all the best of the covies for you
    to be found in the match-making trade
    Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale
    through which I dimly saw a passage
    
    and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk
    that gave him plenty of time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange his life
