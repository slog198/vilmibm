    And, above all, no blowing of the nose
    You know, I could use a financial advisor
    Here lies a judge, whose last words I indite
    I look to you to make it a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me
    
    hearing his voice, meeting his eye
    Even if she be not harmed
    as they term the different classes of boats
    without the Warrant of an especial Judge
    
    every day, like a new holocaust
    The dinner too in its turn was highly admired
    then increase the Fire from one degree to another
    The initiated however were required
    
    It could not possibly be for any longer time
    West-wind, in thy glory and pride
