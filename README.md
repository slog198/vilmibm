    so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows
    and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
    and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows
    Kurtz was dead, and the station had been burnt--and so on--and so on
    
    Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground
    whereby it becomes a coagulated Ice
    SUNDERLAND: Paper Mill Workers Union
    even to the sore head that animal is afflicted with more or less occasionally
    
    146; and in London, where there is also none
    The horror-stricken visitors looked at the calm
    But, now that Iâ€™m perfectly sure I have none
    and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm
    
    the quaintness of these retreats in the day
    I am blest; It turns my darkest night to day
