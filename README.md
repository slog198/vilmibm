    Somehow I felt glad that Jonathan was not on the sea last night
    we naturally use the words weigh
    so much the better--my position was all the freer

    Fully impressed with this conception
    I had no hesitation in complying with
    Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers
    as the Appearance of Spirits
    
    Of seraph's song, and demon's moan
    I give rein to them, and they go on so patient
    because it can in no wise help nor advantage you
    ’ ‘I’d rather finish my tea
    
    yes--I will not forget that
    and forty sheep, and six vessels of wine
