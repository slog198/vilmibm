    therefore, is not to be in a hurry
    You tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it
    A little before dark I passed a farm-house
    was murdered by the king of that country
    
    We felt meditative, and fit for nothing but placid staring
    so I took the liberty of coming to ask
    Many of its buildings
    they were engaged in conning over their to-morrows task
    
    is equivalent to grasping a new idea
    r the sanitary conditions of workshops
    On the summit of the East Cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment
    and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops
    
    Whenever he spoke of his house he always said we
    which are then sought for by minute and persistent inquiry
